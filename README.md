# Resume

Basic JSON resume rendering script.

> Made before discovering JSON Resume project... 🤦‍♂️

## Status

This project is a WIP and does not offer any interfaces currently. It has been made in around 2 days / nights.

## Notes

As this project has been made before discoverying the [JSON Resume project](https://jsonresume.org), it is completely useless...

But, you are still free to use it.

## Schema

The current schema is __similar but not compatible__ with the [JSON Resume schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema).

> I'll try to make it compatible at some point but it's not the priority for the moment.
